# Now Updated for use with the Hack RPI Discord!
Usage is pretty simple.
1) Clone repo
2) Make a discord bot with "admin" perms selected under bot perms (I'm sure you can find a guide on how to do this), and add it to the server you want to copy as the highest admin
3) Make a new discord server and remove all channels and roles
4) Add the bot to the new server
2) Run ```main-EN.py```
3) Get your bot's token from the bot tab of the discord developer portal (it should be fine to reset - you're only using it once, at least for now)
4) When requested, enter it in the terminal
5) Ignore the fact that the logging output isn't in English
6) Clean up discord server (remove old bot roles, change dates, etc.)
